##OK So I have been thinking about this for a long time now.
This is going to be huge task for me, if I consider that I don't want vibe code or copy this project from somwhere else, for multiple reasons:
1)I am probably going to be interacting with HTML, CSS at the very least
2)The tougher element is that there is going to be at least minimal interaction with Javascript if not more
3)I could also end up using a JS Framework
4)I don't think there is any major need for a backend right now? We'll address this issue sooner or later


I'll start by intializing a Git repository, and then build from there. Expect this README file to change alongside future commits :)

I am going to be trying to plan the website by first building the website in vanilla HTML (+ CSS (+ JavaScript))

And then try a DYNAMIC website using ReactJS

THE WEBSITE IS LIVE AT: https://pr4njal.github.io/portfolioWebsite/

I have added some cool components that have to be integrated in the website(optional)
But also I have to check the color scheme

So far some cool resources I have used a W3School, ofcourse MDN and finally GFG websites (In decreasing order of usage)
