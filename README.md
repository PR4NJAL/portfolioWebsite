# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

## OK So I have been thinking about this for a long time now.
This is going to be huge task for me, if I consider that I don't want vibe code or copy this project from somwhere else, for multiple reasons:
- I am probably going to be interacting with HTML, CSS at the very least
- The tougher element is that there is going to be at least minimal interaction with Javascript if not more
- I could also end up using a JS Framework
- I don't think there is any major need for a backend right now? We'll address this issue sooner or later

I am going to be trying to plan the website by first building the website in vanilla HTML (+ CSS (+ JavaScript))

And then try a DYNAMIC website using ReactJS

THE WEBSITE IS LIVE AT: https://pr4njal.github.io/portfolioWebsite/

I have added some cool components that have to be integrated in the website(optional)

So far some cool resources I have used a W3School, ofcourse MDN and finally GFG website

I do want to end up writing some tests, make a CI/CD pipeline, and start working on the backend

I am still confused how should I handle the form submission????
